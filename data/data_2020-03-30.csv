1404,2020-03-30,Britain's initial death toll was put at half a million  then 50 000  later 20 000  now maybe 5000. What are these numbers based on? (To say a lockdown is working might be a copout too.),Goa

2913,2020-03-30, @narendramodi_in Lock down &amp; curfew is OK but State Govts like Maharashtra not allowing special international flights from Mumbai to evacuate their citizens seems unreasonable. Flights are not bringing in passengers but taking them out @MoCA_GoI @OfficeofUT,Pune
2914,2020-03-30,Requested you do complete lockdown there is no need to open grocery shop cause people don't understand the situation so there is one solution I hope you understand its.Complete lockdown for 5 Day or else till 14th April cause for poor people you are doing all necessary things.,Pune
2915,2020-03-30,@narendramodi On what basis this was denied?. The lockdown can eased of only if the numbers fall. This is not like in 21 days the water level will fall &amp; we all be safe. May or May not https://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reports-on-plan-to-extend-21-day-lockdown-baseless-says-government/story-IK3gi5R1YvHy3Y9hsCWh2O.html Application for english news https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.indianewsapps.englishnewspaper,Pune

2917,2020-03-30,That’s April Fool from Gauba. Soon 3- months lockdown will be forced on us ,Pune
2918,2020-03-30,It is seen in the PCMC area particularly in Wakad  that some stores which dont come under Essential Commodities Act to deliver or to give away things which come under the same are open during this lockdown. They are the reason why essence of lockdown is broken. Please take action,Pune
2919,2020-03-30,So true. The lockdown is all about no moment. So no spread. These guys are trying to stupid angles to it. The right approach was to take care by sheltering &amp; feeding. Not transporting. ,Pune

2924,2020-03-30,Right Mam. They should have first made a plan for 140 cr people  gathered logistic and inventory and then once it was in place after 15 days  they would have gone for lock down. Till then only a Lac of people would have got infected.. Bloody moron!!,Pune
