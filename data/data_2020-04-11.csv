1,2020-04-11,#The government have stockpiled loads of bombs and missiles for war but don't have enough PPE for medical staffs forget about anyone else. Govt needs donations to fight Coronavirus but keep on spending on weapons and useless statue and self-promotion. #PehleHealthcare,Bihar
2,2020-04-11,Poorly geared healthcare staff at government hospitals are risking their lives in the fight against the coronavirus! Healthcare sector needs funds  not claps. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
3,2020-04-11,Govt has made a deliberate shift from public healthcare and propped up the private healthcare industry and private health insurance. Result is a public health sector that is coming undone now that an unprecedented challenge of Coronavirus has suddenly surfaced. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
4,2020-04-11,India has one of the widest disparities in healthcare access and quality between the rich and poor! Coronavirus doesn't discriminate  but health care system in India does. What is the govt doing to correct this? #PehleHealthCare,Bihar

9,2020-04-11,@rahulkanwal when are you planning to do an investigation against your bosses in the govt for not doing enough testing of COVID19? Is your spine straight? #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
10,2020-04-11,Even earlier  we had hunger related deaths. Things have gotten worse since lockdown. Malnourished bodies are less immune to disease  including #COVID19. We can't fight against COVID19 without also fighting against hunger. #PehleHealthCare #भूख_मिटाओ_कोरोना_भगाओ,Bihar
11,2020-04-11,NaMo's legacy in public health as Gujarat CM Gujarat spent 4.39% of state expend on health in 1999. By 2009 this came down to 0.77%. Result: Lack of hospital beds  ventillators & ICUs. Consequence: Highest fatality rate in COVID19. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
12,2020-04-11,Gujarat has seen the highest fatality rate amongst COVID19 affected patients (7.88% as opposed to 2.87% for India as a whole). The public health system of Gujarat which is lying in shambles is one of the main reasons behind this. Please #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
13,2020-04-11,The pandemic has revealed the inadequacies of a privatized healthcare system in dealing with crisis. The biggest example of this is the USA  which is having a tough time. On the other hand  a communist Cuba is actively helping even other countries fight COVID19! #PehleHealthCare,Bihar

15,2020-04-11,Hey @RubikaLiyaquat  when was the last time before COVID19 that you discussed public health? India faces an estimated shortage of 160 000 hospital beds. Govt spends only 1.3% of GDP on health. Media is supposed to raise these issues  but you never did. Shame on u #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
16,2020-04-11,Mr. @rahulkanwal tum to bade besharam nikle. You are the most slimy propagandist for BJP and its hate politics. India had its first COVID19 positve case on 30th Jan. Will you ever ask the govt what it was doing in Feb and half of March? #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
17,2020-04-11,The media keeps calling communists anti-national. But how is communist ruled Kerala a model state in dealing with #COVID19. Answer lies not just in emergency relief measures but in its robust health system. Anti-nationals are those who neglect public health. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
18,2020-04-11,Before the COVID19 stuck  when was the last time you saw the Godi media do a debate on the health system in India? These channels are truly anti-national. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
19,2020-04-11,In mid March  while other states prepared for a battle against COVID-19  MP was in political turmoil  as BJP toppled the Congress govt & Shivraj Singh Chouhan became CM for 4th time. Now MP in major crisis  hundreds of COVID19 cases. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
20,2020-04-11,It seems that the lockdown is going to be extended. 3 weeks of lockdown & we haven't been able to flatten the curve. One reason for that is that we haven't been testing enough. Along with lockdown  the key to fighting COVID19 remains Test  Test  Test. #PehleHealthCare,Bihar
21,2020-04-11,Countries  like Germany  with a robust public health system have tackled COVID19 effectively. Even in India  the state of Kerala stands out because of its better public health system  sustained by an overall high govt spending in this sector. Any lessons here? #PehleHealthCare,Bihar

2686,2020-04-11,@jairbolsonaro sir what will you do with the economy if people die? Please control this with a lockdown before this haunts you forever. Now there are signs about covid &amp; social distances across the world &amp; this is a fact. Not an opinion anymore. Let sanity prevail!,Pune
2687,2020-04-11,@narendramodi just a suggestion Only effected areas should put on lockdown like area's in Mumbai  Pune  obviously Mumbai is financial capital of India   we should only seal and lockdown the effected areas so that loss can be reduced by 30-40% .,Pune
2688,2020-04-11,Central Government and Modi must make it clear to all the CMs recommending Lock Down that Centre will not be able to to give any further money to the states as it is already bankrupt. However CMs will be free to aporoach China and sell their respective states to fight hunger.,Pune

2691,2020-04-11,Looks like China has given enough bribe to our CMs for the extension of the Lockout.China knows if India is under lockdown for 6/8 weeks it will totally become bankrupt and go back by at least 5 years. That will force India to beg money from China... Foolish Govts..foolish CMs.,Pune
2692,2020-04-11,It doesn't make sense to keep districts free from infection so far under lockdown. Such districts should be sealed at their borders and all activities within must be allowed. This will help adminstration in diverting resources to the needy districts. ,Pune

2695,2020-04-11,I think it's irrational to have uniform lockdown policy for such a vast nation. From 15th April onwards we must open up districts free from infection. These districts must however be sealed at their borders. All activities within the such district must be allowed.,Pune

5051,2020-04-11,Looks like China has given enough bribe to our CMs for the extension of the Lockout.China knows if India is under lockdown for 6/8 weeks it will totally become bankrupt and go back by at least 5 years. That will force India to beg money from China... Foolish Govts..foolish CMs.,Pune
5052,2020-04-11,It doesn't make sense to keep districts free from infection so far under lockdown. Such districts should be sealed at their borders and all activities within must be allowed. This will help adminstration in diverting resources to the needy districts. ,Pune
