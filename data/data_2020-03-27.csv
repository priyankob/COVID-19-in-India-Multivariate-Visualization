5999,2020-03-27,Most important advise for us in India. We have got a second window to act by the lockdown. If we don’t wake up and start- 1) Testing  identifying  Isolating. 2) Train &amp; deploy health workforce. 3) Equip- Ventilators  PPE We may not get another chance to survive this epidemic. ,Dehradun
6000,2020-03-27,@tsrawatbjp sir  please don’t dilute the lockdown measures. Our only weapon against the spread of the virus in our state. Rather than relax timings it would be better to follow PUNJAB model of distribution to homes. Roads are full of traffic today. This could be our undoing.,Dehradun
