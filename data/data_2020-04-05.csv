10,2020-04-05,If you are a supporter of this regime  please ask the government to: 1) Immediately provide protective gear to healthcare workers. 2) Test more people. Without these two  India's fight against Coronavirus can't be fought. Andhbhakti will be harmful for India. #TestKaroNa,Bihar

16,2020-04-05,Dear Paul   sorry to hear about your better half being diagnosed with #Covid19. I read her description  very informative no temp just mild cough. Among the symptoms saying Fever in 98%. But atypical presentation not uncommon. Very glad she is well. Thanks God. Best of luck.,Bihar
17,2020-04-05,Some of us lights up Diyas  Candles  Flashlights etc. and some burns crackers too Conclusion:- In this critical #Quarantine time at least we all got a small reason to stay Happy #CreateLoveNotHate &amp; We all unitedly Stand against #COVID19 #stayHome #staySafe #keepSocialDistancing,Bihar
18,2020-04-05,Germany is doing 350 000 tests per week. Among other reasons  it's also one why its death rate is as low as 1.4 percent  while Italy  Spain  France  Britain all have more than 10% India needs to test more  only way to get over this nightmare soon. #TestKaroNa #COVID19,Bihar
19,2020-04-05,2 tasks done. Okay  can we now expect the number of people being tested for #COVID19 to increase? #TestKaroNa,Bihar

21,2020-04-05,@narendramodi for Our country #COVID19 ,Bihar
22,2020-04-05,60% of all COVID19 positive cases are linked to Tablighi Jamat. But isn't this because they have been tested  whereas the overall testing is very little. Test more  and you will realise the real picture is very different. #TestKaroNa,Bihar
23,2020-04-05,The PM thinks of the people as sheep  who can be herded in any direction. The docs are facing a shortage of safety gear. The country has one of the lowest number of testing for #COVID19. And he wants us one day to clap &amp; another day to light candles. Wake up  India. #TestKaroNa,Bihar
24,2020-04-05,With the kind of density of population in India  specially in pockets where poor reside  there is an urgent need for mass testing. The Dharavi casualty due to #COVID19 should be an eye opener. #TestKaroNa,Bihar
25,2020-04-05,Appeal to the media: Please stop acting as Modi's personal PR machine. Ask the right questions. Such as: 1) Why is there lack for protective gear for our healthcare workers? 2) Why are there so few #COVID19 tests? It is a test of your love for India. #TestKaroNa,Bihar
26,2020-04-05,Central Govt must consider number of Covid19 cases &amp; hotspots to decide allocation of State Disaster Risk Management Fund to states Under the current scheme states like Delhi  Kerala &amp; Punjab have a large number of positive cases but are receiving very little funds from SDRMF,Bihar
27,2020-04-05,Most of our media is not interested in raising substantive questions regarding our response to COVID19. They are interested in praising their supreme leader or communalizing the pandemic. It is left to citizens to ask why is their lack of gear for docs &amp; so few tests? #TestKaroNa,Bihar
28,2020-04-05,Rather than acting as Modi's personal PR firm for his antics  is it not the responsibility of our TV news channels to ask the govt why are there so few tests for #COVID19? #TestKaroNa,Bihar
29,2020-04-05,Maharashtra and Kerala have recorded the most number of people tested positive for #COVID19. Is it a coincidence that these are also the states which have had the highest number of tests? We will never know the real picture unless we test enough people. #TestKaroNa,Bihar
30,2020-04-05,A doctor on a TV debate said that the official numbers of number of people tested positive for #COVID19 reveals only the tip of the iceberg. We aren't testing enough people  so we don't know the real picture. India has one of the lowest numbers of tests in the world. #TestKaroNa,Bihar

1905,2020-04-05,We will never know the real numbers for Covid-19 in India if we don't test widely for it. The bulk of carriers of the virus are likely to be asymptomatic. So they can be identified only through tests. RationDiyaKya #TestKaroNa,Bihar
